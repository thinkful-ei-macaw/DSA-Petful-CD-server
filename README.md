# Petful Server
  Our server uses two endpoints: /people and /pets

  On the /pets endpoint you can do a GET and a DELETE request. A GET request will send back the first pet in the queue for both "dogs" and "cats". a DELETE request will remove the first animal from their respective queue.

  On the /people endpoint you can do a GET and a POST request. The GET request will send back the whole list of people in the queue. The POST resquest will add a person to the end of the queue.
